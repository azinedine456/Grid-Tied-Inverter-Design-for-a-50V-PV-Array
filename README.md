# Grid-Tied-Inverter-Design-for-a-50V-PV-Array

This is the github reposity of an academic project at the EiCNAM.

## Project Objectives 
- Designing an inverter leg that meets project specifications.
- Simulating a full inverter on LTspice.
- Eperimenting with different controllers (Proportional / Hysterisis)
